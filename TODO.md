## Features
- [ ] **Clock Hands** teacher with quizzes
- [ ] **Soccer** : make a delay before the open player moves, and make him inch away after a 1 second delay, not snap to that space. This shows him "moving" to a child
- [ ] **Soccer**: make corridors on the left and right side of the field, 30% of the width of the field. these are the right and left wings. let me choose via drag/drop where the open player should be: middle of the field, right wing, or left wing. Make the whole field scrollable and visible. On tablet/phone/desktop horizontal mode, the field should take up almost the whole screen. The option selection should drop down when clicked, and then go back up when clicked again.
